    st.markdown("Here we present 7946 records of exotic insect species in New Zealand and their associations with >1000 plant taxa. The dataset represents >260 insect species from several major groups of plant-feeding insects (herbivores), including aphids, leafhoppers, thrips, weevils, and scale insects (armoured scales, soft scales, mealybugs). Plant taxa include endemic species (only found in New Zealand); indigenous species (found naturally in New Zealand but also elsewhere); and exotic species (either accidentally or deliberately introduced into New Zealand by humans).")
